# Model Selection #

Transcribe architecture has two primary components that require model selection
- Speech to Text
- LLM Responses

## Speech to Text
Speech to text aspect can be done locally or online using the Whisper API. Online Speech to Text requires use of `-api` option on command line.

### Local Speech to Text
Local Speech to Text requires model selection. By default the `base` model for English is used. This model is downloaded on the first invocation of the application. There are many more models available, though they vary by size and compute power required.

See the help of transcribe `python main.py -h` for further details on local transcription models.

```python
  -m {tiny,base,small,medium,large-v1,large-v2,large-v3,large}, --model {tiny,base,small,medium,large-v1,large-v2,large-v3,large}
                        Specify the LLM to use for transcription.
                        By default tiny english model is part of the install.

                        The models below require higher computing power:

### Online Speech to Text
Online Speech to Text option is enabled using `--api` option. This option does not require model selection as the appropriate model is selected by the API behind the scenes.

## LLM Responses
The quality, cost and speed of responses from LLM depends on the model chosen. Out of the box transcribe uses `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` model as specified in parameters.yaml

```python
    ai_model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0301
```

The model can be changed by altering the config in `parameters.yaml` or `override.yaml` file. 

Details of all models for OpenAI are available at `https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/continuous-model-upgrades`
